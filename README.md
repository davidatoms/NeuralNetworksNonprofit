_Columbia Data Analytics Boot Camp_ - Module 19 - Neural Networks and Deep Learning Models - Created a deep-learning neural network to analyze and classify the success of charitable donations.

## What I Learned/Achieved:
- How to compare the differences between the tradiational machine learning classification and regression models and the neural network models.
- How to describe the perceptron model and its components.
- How to implement neural network models using TensorFlow.
- How to explain the differences in neural network structures to change algorithm performance.
- How to preprocess and construct datasets for neural network models.
- How to compare the differences between neural network models and deep neural networks.
- How to implement deep neural network mdoels using TensorFlow.
- How to save trained TensorFlow models for later use.

## Process and Results:
__Step 1 Data Pre-Processing__ :
* Review the names and types of data,
* Drop unnecessary columns,
* Prepare the data for Step 2.

__Step 2 Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model__ :
* Compiled the data,
* Trained the model,
* Printed the performance. 

__Step 3 Optimization of the model__ :
* Review the performance printed from step 2,
* Make changes,
* Rerun.

## Summary:
| Model Name | Accuracy Performance |
| ----------- |-|
| 2 | 46% |
| 3 | 73% |
| 4 | 72.7% | 

The model did not achieve the target model performance of 75%. The 3rd and fourth models were the closest, yet they did not achieve the target result. I had a hard time figuring out which variables were affecting the neural model. I believe with some more time and different reading, I could write a program that achieved the target model performance metric.
