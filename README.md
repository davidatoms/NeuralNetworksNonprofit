Columbia Data Analytics Boot Camp - Module 19 - Neural Networks and Deep Learning Models - Created a deep-learning neural network to analyze and classify the success of charitable donations.

## What I Learned/Achieved:
- How to compare the differences between the tradiational machine learning classification and regression models and the neural network models.
- How to describe the perceptron model and its components.
- How to implement neural network models using TensorFlow.
- How to explain the differences in neural network structures to change algorithm performance.
- How to preprocess and construct datasets for neural network models.
- How to compare the differences between neural network models and deep neural networks.
- How to implement deep neural network mdoels using TensorFlow.
- How to save trained TensorFlow models for later use.
